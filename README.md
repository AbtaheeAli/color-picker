Color-Picker

This frontend application allows user to generate a RBG color by changing the Hue, Saturation, and Lightness sliders. User is allowed to press "Random" button to generate a random color.

The application:

- Responds to user events in React
- Uses state in react to drive changes to a user interface
- Uses properties to drive inline styles to dynamically update the appearance of DOM elements
- Initializes the state to a random color when the page is loaded.
